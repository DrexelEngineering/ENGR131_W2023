# # Activity 8.1: Plot mousetrap car findings
# 

# ## Constructing a list
# 
# If you have easy access to your mousetrap car data, please make a list with the values of one design parameter that you changed iteratively. 
# 
# Make a second list of the distance the car traveled when you used each of those values. Make sure that the order is consistent in both of the lists.
# 
# Note the nature of the data and the units in comments before you make the lists.
# 
# If you don't have access to those data, please use the fishing wire length and distance traveled from the previous  notes.

# In[ ]:


# design parameter:
# units:
...

# distance traveled
# units:
...


# Now, you have two lists. 
# 

# Find out which design parameter value resulted in the *maximum* distance traveled.

# In[ ]:


# find greatest distance traveled


# find the location in the list of the greatest dist


# determine the corresponding design parameter value



# ## How does the design parameter change the distance traveled?
# 
# Lists make it very easy to plot one variable against another, which is a start to exploring the relationship between two parameters.
# 
# Make sure you have imported the `matplotlib` package then apply the [`plot` method](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot).
# 
# The first parameter in the `plot` function goes on the x-axis.

# In[ ]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# make a scatter plot with the design parameter on the x-axis
plt.plot(...)

# label the axes with the appropriate name and units
plt.xlabel(...)
plt.ylabel(...)
