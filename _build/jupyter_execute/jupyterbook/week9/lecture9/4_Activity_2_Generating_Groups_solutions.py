# # ðŸ’» Activity 9.2: Building a Group Assignment Tool
# 
# In this class we build a group assignment tool to assign students randomly to groups. Now it is your job to try to blend all the concepts you learned in this class to create this program. We will start with the classes we discussed in lecture.
# 
# Again, add code where there are `...`

# import the scientific computing library numpy and give it the nickname np

# create a python class called Student
class Student:

# a very useful hint is that if you subtract two set datastructures you get all of the objects that are only in the first list
# before you end the cycle of the loop you want to make sure you add the student you added to the group to the list of grouped students.
# This way you ensure that you do not add them again.
