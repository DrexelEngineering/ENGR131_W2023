We view the diversity of our students, faculty, professional staff, and partners as our strength. As such, we strive to create a culture where everyone can leverage their uniqueness to foster innovation because they feel a sense of belonging.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define diversity as the differences that make us uniquely who we are. This includes both individual (personality, values, attitudes, etc.) and other dimensions of difference including ideological, intellectual, economic, gender, gender identity, ability, sexual orientation, religious, age, racial, cultural, ethnic, visible and invisible disabilities, veteran status, nationality, and all the diversity of our students, faculty, professional staff, alumni, and other partners.\n",

    "\n",
    "###### Anti-racism\n",
    "\n",
    "The active process of identifying and ending racism by changing our organizational systems, policies and structures to redistribute power and resources more equitably among all individuals, both at the personal and systemic levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Belonging\n",
    "\n",
    "A sense of psychological safety that affords the ability for each member of the Drexel University community to be their authentic self without fear of judgement, where everyone can perform at their best because they feel accepted, respected, valued, and heard.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Equity\n",
    "\n",
    "The process by which we aim to achieve fairness through reallocation of University resources and opportunities such that policies, structures, and their implementation work to eliminate historical, systemic disadvantage for the benefit of everyone. This requires providing varying levels of support both at the individual and systemic levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Inclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We adopt [Association of American Colleges and Universities'](https://www.aacu.org/making-excellence-inclusive) definition of inclusion as: The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity—in the curriculum, in the cocurriculum, and in communities (intellectual, social, cultural, geographical) with which individuals might connect—in ways that increase awareness, content knowledge, cognitive sophistication, and empathic understanding of the complex ways individuals interact within systems and institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Institutional Racism\n",
    "\n",
    "Institutional polices, processes and biased practices that favor white people over Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Racism\n",
    "\n",
    "Racial prejudice based on unfounded beliefs and irrational fear combined with institutional power. This can be at the individual level (conscious and subconscious beliefs and actions that promote racism), the interpersonal level (racist slurs or actions), and systemic level (in institutions)."
