# # ðŸ’» Activity 4.3: Analyzing Text
# 
# A common tasks for a computer program is to analyze text for structural characteristics. This can be used to determine readability. We have provided you with a text document from a news article. Build a set of functions, and use the `map` function to count 
# 1. The number of words 
# 2. The average word length
# 3. The average number of words per sentence
# 4. As a bonus plot a histogram of the word length. Use the matplotlib function `hist`
