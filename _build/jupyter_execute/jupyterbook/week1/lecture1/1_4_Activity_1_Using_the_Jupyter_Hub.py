# # Activity: Hello World JupyterHub
# 
# Here are the steps to create a "Hello, World!" assignment in JupyterHub:
# 
# 1. Check your email, we have sent you an email with your group, user name, seating assignments, token, and password
# 
# 2. Move to your seat location and introduce yourself to your group members (share one interesting fact). 
# 
# 3. Have the group leader open [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.coe.drexel.edu/).
# 
# 4. Click on the "New" button in the top right corner of the JupyterHub home page, and select "Python 3" from the drop-down menu. This will create a new Jupyter notebook with a Python kernel.
# 
# 5. Look at the file menu and click share $\rightarrow$ copy link 
# 
# 6. Send these links to your fellow group members. They can connect and collaborate on the same notebook
# 
# 7. In the first cell of the notebook have each group member type `print("Hello, World! My name is <type your name>")`
# 
# 8. Press "Shift + Enter" to execute the code in the cell. You should see the output.
# 
# That's it! You have now created a simple "Hello, World!" assignment in JupyterHub.
