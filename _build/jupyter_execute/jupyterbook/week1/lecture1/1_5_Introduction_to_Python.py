# # üìùWhy Python?

# * Engineers need to be proficient in programming to work smarter not harder

# * Programming is challenging and can be frustrating (at times) $\rightarrow$ the struggles you have today will pay dividends in the future

# * Python is a high-level language meaning complex processes can be achieved with just a few lines of code. 
#     - You can conduct detailed data analysis and visualization
#     - You can develop and train an image classifier
#     - You can do nearly anything you put your mind to

# * Python is designed for readability with simple syntax

# * Python is free and open source
#     - You do not need to pay anything to install and use python
#     - You can read all the gory details of how the code works
#     - You can build tools and sell them as commercial products without obtaining licenses

# * There is a huge developer base of packages for Python, if you can think of it someone has a package for it

# * Python is lightweight and can work on any nearly any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

# * Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
