# ## 1.2.2 Planning for Paving a Driveway
# 
# You are tasked with ordering asphalt to pave a driveway that is 12 feet wide, and 28 feet long. You want the end pavement to be 3 inches thick. When water is added to mix the asphalt it expands by 20\% in volume, after pouring the asphalt reduces in volume by 31 percent. How much asphalt mix will you need to purchase. If it costs $1.03/cubic ft., what is the cost? You should include a safety factor (an excess) of 10\% for material lost during processing.
