# # ðŸ’» Activity 3: Determining the Superbowl Proposition Winner
# 
# We made a Superbowl proposition game for ENGR131 now it is time to determine the winner. The submission are in an excel file your tasks is to calculate the winner. We have provided you a list with the correct outcomes from the superbowl. 

# ## Step 1: Load the File
# 
# The file is named "Super Bowl Propositions.xls" load the file into a Pandas DataFrame. 
# 
# Save it as a variable df

# In[1]:


get_ipython().system('pip install openpyxl')


# In[2]:


# import pandas
import pandas as pd

# use the pd.read_excel to load the excel file
...


# In[3]:


# import pandas
import pandas as pd

# use the pd.read_excel to load the excel file
df = pd.read_excel('Super Bowl Propositions.xlsx')


# Use `df.head()` to look at the first few lines of the DataFrame

# In[4]:


...


# In[5]:


df.head()


# Now we want to get the strings for each of the questions

# In[6]:


# We want to extract the question names
# To do this we want all the column heading that have a ? in the string

# We can start by creating a empty list called questions
...

# now we want to loop around all of the row heading
# You can build a loop that loops around each column name
# The column name can be obtained from df.columns
# save each heading in a temporary variable column
for ... in ...:
    
    # Now we want to check if the variable column is a questions
    # To do this we want to use an if statement that sees if a "?" is in the string
    if ... in ...:
        
        # if this is true we want to add the heading to the list
        # this can be done using the list method .append(obj)
        # the obj is the local variable in the list
        ...

# if you want to check this you can print the columns        
...

        questions.append(column)

# if you want to check this you can print the columns        
print(questions)    


# Now we want to calculate the score. We have provided comments to help you complete this task.
