# # üìù File Handling
# 
# * File handling is a good way to persist data after a program terminates. 

# * Data from a computer program is saved to a file and can be accessed later. 

# * Python, like many other programming languages, provides handy methods for creating, opening, reading and writing data to a file.

# * In Python you can open nearly any type of file.

# ## Where are files located?

# * Files are located on physical non-volatile memory (e.g., spinning disk, solid-state flash, NVMe)

# * Files are mounted via a filesystem and are organized hierarchically

# ![](images/FileSystems.png)

# ## Browsing the filesystem from Python

# * Python has tools to browse the filesystem and modify and write files

# * Python provides the `pathlib` module for  navigating through directories and files, creating folders, identifying file paths, and so on.

# In[1]:


from pathlib import Path


# ### Getting the current working directory
# 
# * This is the path where you are currently operating in

# In[2]:


p = Path.cwd()
print(p)


# ### Specifying Paths
# 
# There are two ways to specify paths:

# 1. The **absolute** path of a file declares its path, beginning with the root folder

# In[3]:


# This will join the current working directory and the test file
print(Path.joinpath(Path.cwd(),"MyTestFile.txt"))

# Checks if the file exists
print(f"If True the file exists : {Path.exists(Path.joinpath(Path.cwd(),'MyTestFile.txt'))}")


# 2. The **relative** path of a file declares its path in relation to the current working directory

# In[4]:


# This will join the current working directory and the test file
print(Path("./MyTestFile.txt"))

# Checks if the file exists
# Note you have to convert the string to a path
print(f"If True the file exists : {Path.exists(Path('./MyTestFile.txt'))}")


# ### Making folders
# 
# You can make folders or directories with Python

# In[5]:


# creates a path object
p = Path('./new_made_folder')

# makes the folder
p.mkdir()


# ### How to change your current working directory
# 
# You can use the `os.chdir` method

# Let's move to the new folder we created

# In[6]:


import os

os.chdir("./new_made_folder/")


# In[7]:


print(Path.cwd())


# You can move back one folder using the ".." path

# In[8]:


os.chdir("..")


# In[9]:


print(Path.cwd())


# <div class="admonition note alert alert-info">
# <p class="first admonition-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Note</p>
# Very similar commands will work from the command line. You can change directories using `cd`, and list contents of the current directory using `ls`.
# </div>

# ### Removing a directory
# 
# It is possible to remove a directory using the `.rmdir()` method on a path object. 

# In[10]:


p.rmdir()


# ### Listing files in a directory
# 
# You can list files in a directory using the `.listdir()` method

# In[11]:


path = '.'
p = Path(path)
p.iterdir()


# This created an object called a generator. Generators can be iterated through using loops

# In[12]:


for file in p.iterdir():
    print(file)


# ## Reading and Writing Data

# There are different access modes for reading and writing files in python

# * `r`: opens a file for reading. The read mode throws an error when the file doesn‚Äôt exist.
# 
# * `r+`: opens the file to read and write data into a file object. An error is thrown if the file doesn‚Äôt exist.

# * `w`: a file is opened in this mode for writing data. The write mode overrides existing data and creates a new file object if it doesn‚Äôt exist.
# 
# * `w+`: opens a file to read and write data. Existing data on file is overridden when opened in this mode.

# * `a`: the append mode appends to a file if the file exists. It also creates a new file if there‚Äôs no existing file. It doesn‚Äôt override existing data.
# 
# * `a+`: this mode opens a file for appending and reading data.
# 
# * `x`: the create mode is used to create files in Python. An error is thrown if the file exists.

# ### Opening files in Python

# To open a file in Python, we can use the `open()` function. 
# 
# * It takes at least two arguments ‚Äî the filename, and the mode description ‚Äî and returns a file object

# In[13]:


f = open("./MyTestFile.txt", 'r')


# ### Reading files

# You can read the file object using the `.read()` method. This returns all characters.

# In[14]:


f.read()


# Note:
# 
# * The read automatically adds line breaks \n but since we did not interpret the string it displays the text
# * We cannot read a file twice, once it read to the end you need to open the file to start over

# In[15]:


f.read()


# In[16]:


f = open("./MyTestFile.txt", 'r')
print(f.read())


# ### Reading a line
# 
# The `.readline()` method allows you to read one line of a file a time. 

# In[17]:


f = open("./MyTestFile.txt", 'r')
for i in range(3):
    print(f.readline())


# ### Reading all lines
# 
# The `.readlines()` method returns all lines in a file as a list

# In[18]:


f = open("./MyTestFile.txt", 'r')

for i, line in enumerate(f.readlines()):
    print(f"line {i} is: {line}")


# ### Closing Files
# 
# Files like kitchen cabinets do not close themselves. If you don't close a file it runs the risk of it being corrupted. 
# 
# To close a file use the `.close()` method

# In[19]:


f.close()


# ## The `with` Statement
# 
# Since it is so easy to forget to close a file it is best practice to use the `with`. `with` automatically closes a file after the last operation in a scope (i.e., what is indented) is complete.

# ### Syntax
# 
# ```python
# with open("filename", "mode") as local_object:
#     local_object.do_something()
# ```

# In[20]:


with open("./MyTestFile.txt", 'r') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f.readlines()):
        print(f"line {i} is: {line}")


# ## Writing to a file
# 
# When writing to a file it is best practice to use the `with` statement.

# ### Appending to a file

# In[21]:


with open("./MyTestFile.txt", 'a+') as f:
    # we need to add the new line character
    f.write('\n manual added line')


# Since we are going to read and print the file many times let's make a function

# In[22]:


def read(file):
    f = open(file, 'r')

    for i, line in enumerate(f.readlines()):
        print(f"line {i} is: {line}")


# In[23]:


read("./MyTestFile.txt")


# ### Writing multiple lines at once with `.writelines()` method

# `.writelines()` adds a list to a file

# In[24]:


list_ = ['\n added line as list 1', '\n added line as list 2']

with open("./MyTestFile.txt", 'a+') as f:
    # we need to add the new line character
    f.writelines(list_)


# In[25]:


read("./MyTestFile.txt")


# **What happens when we change `a+` to `w`**

# In[26]:


list_ = ['added line as list 1', '\n added line as list 2']

with open("./MyTestFile.txt", 'w') as f:
    # we need to add the new line character
    f.writelines(list_)


# In[27]:


read("./MyTestFile.txt")


# We overwrote the file. Good thing we have a copy. Let's delete the modified file and replace it with our backup copy.

# ### Deleting the file

# In[28]:


p = Path('./MyTestFile.txt')

p.unlink()


# ### Copying the file using `shutil.copyfile()`

# In[29]:


import shutil

shutil.copyfile('./MyTestFile copy.txt', './MyTestFile.txt')


# ## Opening Common File Formats
# 
# `.txt` files are great because of their simplicity and interoperability sometimes data is stored in more complex structures. Python provides tools to open nearly any file format ever created. We will introduce opening some common file formats.

# ### Comma Separated Variables
# 
# * Many system monitoring and manufacturing sensors record several variables at a single time. These are commonly stored as comma separated variable 

# If you were a city planner you might be interested in understanding traffic patterns depending on several factors. 

# In[30]:


import csv

# opens the file
with open('Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv', 'r') as f:
    
    # csv reader
    csv_reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')
    
    # number of lines counted
    line_count = 0
    
    # makes a list
    values_ = []
    
    # loops around the number of rows
    for row in csv_reader:
        
        # if on the first row saves the data as a header
        if line_count == 0:
            headers = row
            line_count += 1
        else:
            # else will append the values
            values_.append(row)
            line_count += 1
    print(f'Processed {line_count} lines.')


# In[31]:


print(headers)
print(values_[0])


# ### Loading an Excel File
# 
# There are more developed tools that can deal with more complex data structures, and have more elaborate built it methods.

# One package is called Pandas

# In[32]:


get_ipython().system('pip install xlrd')


# In[32]:


import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_excel("Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.xls")


# Pandas DataFrames have many functions:

# In[33]:


df.head()


# Getting the max value

# In[34]:


df['rain_1h'].max()


# Getting the Unique Values

# In[35]:


df['weather_description'].unique()


# Multilevel indexing

# In[36]:


df[df['rain_1h']>10]['traffic_volume']


# Even plotting

# In[37]:


df[df['rain_1h']>10]['traffic_volume'].hist()


# In[ ]:
