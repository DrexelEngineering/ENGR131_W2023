# ## History of Rock, Paper, Scissors
# 
# Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone," or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo) is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
# 
# A simultaneous, zero-sum game, each round has three possible outcomes: a tie, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The game spread from China while developing different variants in signs over time.

# **Task 1: Check for valid input** 
# 
# In your game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, it will be the player vs. the computer. The player will make their selection each round by typing either `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`. The first task is to write a function that checks to make sure that the input entered by the player is valid.
# 
# Write python code to do the following:
# 
# * Complete the function called `valid_input` which takes as input a string `player_choice`.
# * The function should return `True` if `player_choice` equals `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`.
# * Otherwise the function should return `False`. 
# 
# Your code replaces the prompt:  `...`

# In[ ]:


def valid_input(player_choice):
    ...

# use this to check your results
valid_input("paper")


# In[ ]:


grader.check("task1-input")


# **Task 2: Get Round Result Message** 
# 
# In each round, we want to display a result message that explains the outcome. Your next task is to write a function to determine the message that should displayed based on the choices of the player and computer. The table below shows the message to display if the player and computer choose different options. 
# 
# <center>
# 
# | `player_choice` | `computer_choice` | `message` |
# | --- | --- | --- |
# | `"rock"` | `"paper"` | `"You lose! Paper covers rock."` |
# | `"rock"` | `"scissors"` | `"You win! Rock crushes scissors."` |
# | `"paper"` | `"rock"` | `"You win! Paper covers rock."` |
# | `"paper"` | `"scissors"` | `"You lose! Scissors cuts paper."` |
# | `"scissors"` | `"rock"` | `"You lose! Rock crushes scissors."` |
# | `"scissors"` | `"paper"` | `"You win! Scissors cuts paper."` |
# 
# </center>
# 
# If the player and the computer make the same choice, the the displayed message should be:
# `"It's a tie!"` 
# 
# Write python code to do the following:
# 
# * Complete the function called `round_message` which takes in two strings, `player_choice` and `computer_choice`.
# * If the player and computer choose different options, the function should return a string containing the appropriate message based on the table above.
# * If the player and computer choose the same, then the tie message above should be returned.
# 
# Your code replaces the prompt:  `...`

def round_message(player_choice, computer_choice):
    ...

# use this to check your results
round_message("paper", "scissors")


# In[ ]:


grader.check("task2-round-message")


# **Task 3: Get Final Message** 
# 
# The game will be played in rounds until one player has reached a score of 2. When the game ends, a final message is displayed indicating whether the player won or lost. Your final task is to write the function that determines this final message based on the score.
# 
# Write python code to do the following:
# 
# * Complete the function called `final_message` which takes in two integers, `player_score` and `computer_score`.
# * If the `player_score` is greater than `computer_score`, return the string: `"You won the game!"`
# * If the `player_score` is less than `computer_score`, return the string: `"You lost the game!"` 
# * You don't need to worry about handling a tie, since the game will only end when someone has won.
# 
# Your code replaces the prompt:  `...`
