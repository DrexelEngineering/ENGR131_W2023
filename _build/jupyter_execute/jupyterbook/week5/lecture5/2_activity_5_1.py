# # ðŸ’» Activity 5.1: Nuclear Plant Temperature Alert
# 
# We have just covered the relationship of a process value to a desired set point and discussed the importance of redundancy, especially in systems that have the potential to harm people.
# 

# Consider a nuclear reactor. A meltdown would be sufficiently catastrophic that the temperature of the cooling water around the nuclear fuel rods is monitored by four sensors. 
# 
# An alarm should go off if 
# 1. any of the two sensors report a temperature greater than 100 degrees Celsius, or 
# 2. any two of the sensor readings disagree by strictly 8 degrees. 
# 
# Write a function `coolingWaterAlarm(t1,t2,t3,t4)` where `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, and `t4` are the temperature readings for sensor 1, sensor 2, sensor 3, and sensor 4, respectively. 
# 
# The function should print 
# 
# 1. `Alarm! Temperatures differ.` if the first condition above is met,
# 2. `Alarm! Temperatures exceed 100 deg Celsius.` if the second condition above is met, or
# 3.  `Normal operation` if neither condition is met.
