# # üìù Introduction to Branching

# ## Utility of branching
# 
# Branching causes specific blocks of code to be executed only under certain conditions. The conditions are articulated as logical expressions. 

# ## How do you write branching statements?
# 
# The simplest version of branching statement is an "if statement". 

# ```python
# if logical_expression:
#     code_block
# ```
# 

# More complex structures are possible with "if-else statements". 

# ```python
# if logical_expression_A:
#     code_block_1
# elif logical_expression_B:
#     code_block_2
# elif logical_expression_C:
#     code_block_3
# else: 
#     code_block_4
# ```
# 

# ## Using branching in basic control theory
# 
# Many engineering interventions aim to maintain an optimal setting in a system. Control theory is the basis for achieving these optimal conditions as smoothly and consistently as possible.

# 

# One very common example is *temperature control in buildings*. 
# 
# * Architectural engineers learn how to design heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems throughout buildings that allow temperature in a room to be controlled. 
# 
# * Electrical engineers help with innovating the sensors and controls that allow for the temperature to be optimized. 
# 
# * Material scientists improve designs of windows and doors to enhance the controllability of the temperature and sustainability of the optimal conditions.

# The thermostat typically acts as both the sensor collecting feedback and the controller determining whether the process should be heating, cooling, or no intervention. 

# The very simplest process control requires only the process variable, or the room temperature in this case, and the set point, or the desired temperature in this case.

    if roomTemp < desiredTemp - 5:
        device = "heat"
    elif roomTemp > desiredTemp + 5:
        device = "AC"
    else:
        device = "nothing"
    return device

# Perhaps you have a roommate who is very sensitive to temperature changes. How could you change the `thermostat` function to keep the room temperature closer to the set point?

    return device


# What are at least three other processes you can think of that would similarly rely on branching, especially in your field of study?
# 
# 1. 
# 2. 
# 3. 

# In these systems, which ones have redundancy (e.g., a second method of accomplishing the same thing) either in the sensor that detects the process variable or the processes that can be used to control the process variable?
