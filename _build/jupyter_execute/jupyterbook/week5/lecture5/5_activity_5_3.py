# # ðŸ’» Activity 5.3: Advancing integral evaluations by combining loops and branches

# We wanted to explore how two important choices impact the accuracy of this method for approximating integrals.
# 
# âœ… 1. the width of the rectangle $h$, which is determined by the number of rectangles between $a$ and $b$
# 
# Now, let's explore
# 
# 2. the value of $x$ at which the function is evaluated (left, midpoint, or right)
# 
# ![](https://math.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/6076/5.3.2.png?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=441&height=378)

# ## Interact with the code
# 
# 1. Add the branching structure *inside* the current function to cause different calculations to occur if the `evalPoint` variable is `"right", "mid", or "left"`.
# 
# 2. Include an extra case in which the user receives a helpful message if the string for `evalPoint` is not one of the three options.
