# ## Homework and Lab Grading
# 
# Some of the tests we will evaluate are available in the Jupyter Notebook file you use, but others are specific to our grading process. So, you may pass all of the grader checks that are available to you but not those we are using to grade the homework and labs. 
# 
# To earn full credit, please follow all of the instructions carefully and thoroughly, checking your own work for accuracy thoughtfully. 
# 
# If you find a discrepancy in the grading after checking your code against the solutions, please make any requests for a regrade by emailing evidence (e.g., the lines that show that your submission works as well as the solution) and a request for a grade change to the Professors at engr131.w23@drexel.edu.

# # How would you...
# 

# ... check that a nuclear power plant is not overheating?

# ... have a robot vacuum cover an entire room?
