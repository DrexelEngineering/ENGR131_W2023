# # Peer Programing
# 
# We find it very valuable to work collaboratively on code. Our JupyterHub provides an interface for peer programing. Here we provide instructions

# 1. Make sure you are connected to the Drexel network or logged into the VPN
# 2. Login using the shared credential provided to you. They will look like `Lab_X_Y`, or `Lecture_X_Y`
# ![](./figs/1.png)
# 3. Access the file that you would like to work on either through the website, creating a new file, or uploading it within the interface. 
# 4. Click the share menu and select `share Jupyter server link`
# ![](./figs/2.png)
# 5. Copy the link by clicking `copy link` - Share this link with your team (note, if you use the link provided in your email you will have to navigate to the same file)

# 
# **If you have been provided with a token skip to step**
# 
# 6. Go to file and select `hub control panel`.

# 
# 7. Click on `token`
# 
# ![](./figs/5.png)
# 
# 8. Set a time when the token should expire and click create token
# 
# ![](./figs/6.png)
# 
# 9. Copy the token provided. You will only be able to see this once. 
# 
# ![](./figs/7.png)
# 
# 10. Share the token with your team
# 
# 11. Construct the URL by taking the part that was copied and adding the token to then end.
# 
# It should look something like `https://jupyterhub.coe.drexel.edu/user/XXXXX/lab/?token=YOURTOKENHERE`
