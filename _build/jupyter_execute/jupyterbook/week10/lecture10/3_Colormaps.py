# # üìù Choices for Figures
# 
# - Many choices are necessary when visualizing data. Here, we'll discuss the type of visualization and the color scale representing a dimension of the data.
# 

# ## Types of Graphs
# 

# - [Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) provides a helpful decision tree for selecting the appropriate visualization.
# 
# - Then, examples of each kind of plot are provided along with tips on how to use them appropriately.

# ## Choosing Colors for your Figures

# ### Why do colormaps matter?
# 
# - Your interpretation of the colormap represents a dimension of the data.
# 
# - Use of **an inappropriate colormap** is like having a non-linear y-axis!

# 

# - Python has packages, such as [`palettable`](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable) for finding excellent color maps for color scales.
# 
# - [Colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=PuOr&n=9) has an interactive interface for choosing the appropriate color map, which can then be imported using the `colorbrewer` module in `palettable`. It provides guidance with colorblindness and gray scale printing in mind.
# 
#     - If the data are all positive or negative on a number line (e.g., linear, log), a *sequential* color map is appropriate.
# 
#     - If the data range from negative to positive on a number line (e.g., linear, log), a *diverging* color map is appropriate.
# 
#     - If the data are qualitative, *only then* is a color scheme with unrelated colors adjacent to one another appropriate.
