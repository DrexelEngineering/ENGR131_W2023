# Welcome to ENGR 131

You have the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of programming and algorithmic problem solving with applications in engineering by robust participation in the structured learning Professors Agar and Capps have provided. The reading and exercises are designed so that you might learn to (a) produce clear, robust, and efficient code, and (b) conceptualize and design computational algorithms to solve engineering problems. Our goals for you are that you will possess the programming skills necessary to perform computational analysis in any engineering discipline and that you will use these skills in your classes and co-ops. Because people learn to code through practice, we have included many diverse opportunities for you to gain exposure to algorithmic thinking and python as a language as well as to practice using them. This course is designed for students without any prior programming experience.
