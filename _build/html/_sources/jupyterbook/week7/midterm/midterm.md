Please bring your Drexel ID and a writing utensil (e.g., pen or pencil).

If you are in *a Tuesday lab* or *the 2 pm Monday lecture*, please go to Main Auditorium.

If you are *not in a Tuesday lab* and are also *in the 12 pm Monday lecture*, please go to Mitchell Auditorium in Bossone.

In accordance with the syllabus, absence from labs and examinations will be excused only under extraordinary circumstances. A missed examination without prior approval and without legitimate reason will be graded at zero points. 

If an emergency occurs, please email [engr131.w23@drexel.edu](mailto:engr131.w23@drexel.edu) prior to 8:00 am on February 22, 2023. Otherwise, *the exam will be graded at zero*.
