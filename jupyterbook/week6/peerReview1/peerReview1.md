# Midterm 1 Review with Peers

This assignment will prepare you for the midterm by *having you explain* the ideas and concepts that our class has covered so far. It has two parts. 

In Part 1, you will record a video screencast of yourself explaining each line of code you add while coding the correct answers to a previous lab. 

In Part 2, you will watch screencasts from two other students and provide feedback. 

This assignment will be graded individually. If you complete all parts of the assignment, you will get full credit.

## Part 1: make a screencast redoing the solutions Lab 2, 3, or 4
1. You will be assigned [Lab 2](https://courses.coe.drexel.edu/ENGR/ENGR131W23/jupyterbook/week3/lab2/lab2-scrabble.html), [Lab 3](https://courses.coe.drexel.edu/ENGR/ENGR131W23/jupyterbook/week4/lab3/lab3-image.html), or [Lab 4](https://courses.coe.drexel.edu/ENGR/ENGR131W23/jupyterbook/week5/lab4/lab4-RPS.html) by email as well as group mates who will explain the other two labs.

2. Log in to the Zoom room sent by your Teaching Assistant during the usual time for your lab.

3. Click the Zoom link in the email from your Teaching Assistant to open Zoom on a computer or tablet with a microphone. 
    
    a. A smartphone will not work for this assignment. 
    
    b. If you do not have access to this technology, your TA can help you make alternate arrangements.

4. After an introduction for your homework, your TA will open breakout rooms. 
    a. Please join the breakout room when you are invited to do so.

5. Once you are in the breakout room, unmute yourself. 
    a. You can leave the camera on or off.

6. Open a blank copy of your assigned lab. Then, code the correct solution to the lab while you explain why you are writing each line of code (Lab 2, 3, or 4).
    
    a. If you copy someone else’s video or script, you will get zero credit, and we will report cheating.
    
    b. Practice at least once before you record. Your video should be between 8-18 minutes. If it is shorter, you need to explain more details. If it is longer, you may need to practice more or write yourself a script.
    
    c. Explain code structure, order of operations, syntax, and anything else that is important to the code.
    
    d. You can use any resource you want (including the solutions) to solve the problems, but the video must be your own visuals, words, and audio.


7. In Zoom, use the Share Screen button to share your browser window with Jupyterhub.

8. When you are ready to record, choose “Record to This Computer” (not “record to cloud”). More details on Zoom recording are [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360059781332-Getting-started-with-recording).

9. Open a blank copy of your assigned lab. Then, code the correct solution to the lab while you explain why you are writing each line of code (Lab 2, 3, or 4). 
    a. You don’t have to appear on camera. Please be aware that some of your classmates will see the video.

10. After you finish, click the black square that means “stop recording”. 

11. Return to the main room by leaving the breakout room to show your TA that you completed your video.

12. Log out of Zoom. 
    
    a. Your video may take 5-30 minutes to process. 
    
    b. The folder where the recording is stored should open automatically. Do not close this window.

13. Go to the Drexel Learn VoiceThread assignment in Week 6 and click on “Midterm Screencast Review Assignment”. 
    
    a. Click the yellow “Start Assignment” button on the right.

14. Drag the .mp4 file that was just created in the new folder into the browser window where prompted. More details on submitting VoiceThreads are [here](https://voicethread.com/howto/submitting-create-assignment/). 

15. Complete Part 1 before **noon on Friday, February 17**. 



## Part 2: provide feedback on other students’ videos

1. Go back to the sameW Midterm Screencast Review Assignment in the Week 6 folder of Drexel Learn. 
    a. On the right panel, click on the “Student Gallery” button.

2. You can sort threads by first or last name on the top right to find your group mates. 

3. Watch their screencasts, and leave at least one VoiceThread comment for each of your classmates to see.
    
    a. The “leave comment” button is on the middle bottom of the screen. 
    
    b. The comment should be constructive criticism (e.g. “X was explained well, there is a mistake in Y, etc.”)
    
    c. If you think the problem was done incorrectly, please say so politely.
    
    d. Each lab should be different than the one you recorded so that you get to review each of the labs.

4. Finally, go to the “Screencast Peer Review Form” in the Week 6 folder of Drexel Learn, and fill out the rubric.
    
    a. Only the TAs and professors will see these scores.
    
    b. If the assignment is complete, the rubric score will not affect your grade or your classmate’s grade.
    
5. Finish watching, leaving comments, and filling out the rubric before **noon on Monday, February 20**.

Deadline for submitting screencast: before noon on Friday, February 13
